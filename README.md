# Udacity Feedreader Testing
This is the fourth project assigned in the Udacity Front-End Nanodegree Program. The goal of the project is to get practice using the Jasmine testing framework on a web-based application that reads RSS feeds.

## How to Run
1. You can run the application directly from the page [here](https://github.com/ksirgey/udacity-feedreader-testing), or you can download the github repository [here](https://github.com/ksirgey/udacity-feedreader-testing.git). 
2. Open the index.html file in the browser.

## How to Read
When the page loads, you will see the Jasmine window below the feeds. The Jasmine window displays information about the tests that have been executed. Black items point to 'suites' while green items point to 'specs'. If the application runs correctly, there should be '0' failures. If the testing framework spots inaccuracies in the code, it will indicate where and why they originated.
